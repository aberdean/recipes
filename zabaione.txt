Zabaione is a super simple, but very delicious dessert!

Ingredients:
 - 1/2 cup egg yolks
 - 1/2 cup sugar
 - 3 1/4 tbsp corn starch
 - 3/4 cup Marsala wine
 - 1/4 cup Moscato wine

 Directions:
  1. In a pan, bring the Marsala and the Moscato to a boil.

  2. While the wine is heating up, mix the sugar and corn starch and whisk in the yolks 
     until light and fluffy.

  3. As soon as the wine boils, pour in the yolk mix and stir until it becomes dense.

  4. Take it off the fire. 

  5. To serve it hot, whisk until fluffy and serve right away.
     To serve it cold, cool it as fast as possible (placing it in another bowl with some ice), then leave it in the refrigerator until completely chilled. Then, whisk until fluffy and serve.
